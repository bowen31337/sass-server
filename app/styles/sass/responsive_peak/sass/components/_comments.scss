// Comments
//
// Comments are used when there is an asymmetric relationship between the
// primary piece of content and the comment as opposed to forum replies where
// all the messages in a thread carry relatively equal weight.
//
// Example implementations:
// TKB comments, idea comments, contests comments, Q&A comments (not answers),
// media comments...
//
// Styling notes:
// .lia-message-heading assumes a dropdown on the same plane as the user info.
// Most of the body styling is handled in Messages (_messages.scss) which is
// common to all interaction styles.
